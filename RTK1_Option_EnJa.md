If system level (basic terms) translation is not enough for you, please read the following sections. You can translate more - avator name, class name, text message, and so on. This plugin has some functions which will support your development.

## switch parameter

If you need to know the language selection in game, you should use switch parameter of this plugin. For example, you can show English text in English mode, and Japanese text in Japanese mode.

In plugin setting, please set 1-999 value for switch parameter. The following sample set "8" value.

This value shows the number of switch in RPG maker MV. The switch will engage the language selection - it will be ON in Japanese mode, OFF in English mode.

In this case, let's set the intelligible name (Japanese_Mode) for the 8th switch.

Then, let's use this 8th switch (Japanese_Mode) for "IF..Else..End" block in the event contents;
